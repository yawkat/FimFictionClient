This is a simple java interface for FimFiction.net. Features:

- Account logging in
- Adding, removing favorites and setting email updates
- (Un)marking as read later
- Like / Dislike, with optional specified token
- Like-Token loading
- Story downloading
- Search result parsing
- Getting story metadata

It also contains various example applications I made for personal use, the biggest one being a fully-featured java GUI for fimfiction.net that can search, view favorites, view read later, contains a simple HTTP server for reading epubs in the browser and much more.
