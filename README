- (Un)marking as read later
- Like / Dislike, with optional specified token
- Like-Token loading

It also contains various example applications I made for personal use, the biggest one being a fully-featured java GUI for fimfiction.net that can search, view favorites, view read later, contains a simple HTTP server for reading epubs in the browser and much more.
